## Thesis Opportunities

I regularly co-supervise M.Sc. theses at **Politecnico di Torino** (in collaboration with Links Foundation and University of Turin) on topics related to:

- Blockchain protocol design and smart contract development
- Decentralized data marketplaces and energy applications
- DAO governance analysis and on-chain metrics
- Privacy-preserving techniques (ZK proofs, MPC, FHE)
- Layer 2 scaling solutions and rollup architectures
- Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) and verifiable credentials
- DLT-based secure data exchange for health and energy domains

If you are a master's student interested in a thesis on any of these topics (or something related), feel free to reach out with a short description of your background and interests.

## Research Collaborations

I am always open to collaborating with researchers and engineers working on distributed ledger technologies, applied cryptography, and decentralized systems. I am especially interested in:

- Joint work on EU-funded projects (Horizon Europe, Digital Europe)
- Cross-institutional research visits
- Industry partnerships on blockchain prototyping and proof-of-concept development
- Co-organization of workshops and academic events

## Visiting Researchers

If you are a PhD student or postdoc interested in a short-term research visit at Links Foundation or University of Turin to work on DLT-related topics, please get in touch. I have experience both hosting and being a visiting researcher (Brunel University London, CITIC Universidade da Coru&ntilde;a).
