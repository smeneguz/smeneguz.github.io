## Bio

I am a PhD Candidate in **Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technologies** within the [National PhD Program ISAS](https://isas.unicam.it/dni/blockchain-and-DLT) (University of Turin &ndash; University of Camerino). My research is carried out jointly at the [Department of Computer Science, University of Turin](https://www.di.unito.it/do/home.pl) and the [Links Foundation](https://linksfoundation.com/en/) in Torino, Italy.

My work sits at the intersection of **distributed systems**, **applied cryptography**, and **software engineering**. I focus on designing blockchain-based data marketplaces (with emphasis on the energy domain), investigating DAO governance sustainability through on-chain metrics, and exploring privacy-preserving techniques such as Zero-Knowledge proofs, Multi-Party Computation, and Fully Homomorphic Encryption.

In 2024&ndash;2025, I was a **visiting researcher** at [Brunel University London](https://www.brunel.ac.uk/), broadening my perspective on international DLT research.

Beyond research, I am actively involved in community building: I serve as organiser and licensee of [TEDxSchio](https://www.ted.com/profiles/10204915/about), and I have directed the [Startup Grind Padova](https://www.startupgrind.com/) chapter. I am also an [Ocean Protocol Ambassador](https://oceanprotocol.com/).
