## Bio

I am a PhD in **Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technologies** within the [National PhD Program ISAS](https://isas.unicam.it/dni/blockchain-and-DLT) (University of Turin / University of Camerino). My research is carried out jointly at the [Department of Computer Science, University of Turin](https://www.di.unito.it/do/home.pl) and [Links Foundation](https://linksfoundation.com/en/) in Torino.

I work on **distributed systems**, **applied cryptography**, and **software engineering**. Concretely, I design blockchain-based data marketplaces for the energy domain, study DAO governance sustainability through on-chain metrics, and experiment with privacy-preserving techniques like Zero-Knowledge proofs, MPC, and FHE. I also have a growing interest in Layer 2 scaling solutions and the foundational protocol layer of blockchain systems.

In 2024-2025, I spent time as a **visiting researcher** at [Brunel University London](https://www.brunel.ac.uk/).

Outside of research, I organise [TEDxSchio](https://www.ted.com/profiles/10204915/about), have directed the [Startup Grind Padova](https://www.startupgrind.com/) chapter, and serve as an [Ocean Protocol Ambassador](https://oceanprotocol.com/).
