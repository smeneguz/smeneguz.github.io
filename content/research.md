## Research Areas

<div class="research-area">
  <h3>Blockchain-Based Data Marketplaces</h3>
  <p>
    Most of my PhD work revolves around decentralized data marketplace architectures for the <strong>energy domain</strong>.
    I look at how to enable privacy-preserving, trustworthy, and interoperable data exchange using technologies
    like Ocean Protocol, IDSA connectors, and GAIA-X dataspaces. One concrete outcome is a sub-8 second
    decentralized marketplace for energy data, showing that these systems can actually work at practical speeds.

<div class="research-area">
  <h3>DAO Governance and Sustainability</h3>
  <p>
    I study <strong>Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)</strong> with a focus on what makes their governance
    sustainable over time. This includes defining on-chain metrics to measure governance health, building
    game-theoretic incentive models for participation, and running empirical analyses on real DAO data to
    understand why some organizations thrive and others don't.

<div class="research-area">
  <h3>Privacy-Preserving Cryptographic Techniques</h3>
  <p>
    I am interested in bringing advanced cryptographic primitives closer to practice. My work touches on
    <strong>Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proofs</strong>, <strong>Multi-Party Computation (MPC)</strong>, and
    <strong>Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)</strong>, with the goal of enabling privacy-preserving
    computations and verifiable data exchanges on blockchain systems.

  <h3>Layer 2 Scaling and Rollups</h3>
  <p>
    I follow and contribute to the L2 ecosystem, looking at how rollups and off-chain scaling solutions
    can address throughput and cost limitations of base-layer blockchains. This includes studying rollup
    architectures (optimistic and ZK-based), cross-layer composability, and how L2s can serve as
    infrastructure for data marketplace and DApp deployment.

  </div>
</div>

<div class="research-area">
  <h3>Blockchain Foundations: Protocols and Consensus</h3>
  <p>
    Beyond applications, I care about the underlying protocol layer. I study consensus mechanisms,
    network-level properties, and protocol design trade-offs. This foundational interest informs my
    applied work and connects to hands-on experience building blockchain nodes from scratch (e.g., my
    <a href="https://github.com/smeneguz/Rust-Chain">Rust-Chain</a> project) and working with Cosmos SDK
    and Hyperledger Fabric in production contexts.

## Collaborators and Groups

My research is carried out within two main groups:

- **[Links Foundation](https://linksfoundation.com/en/)** (Torino) -- Applied research centre established by Compagnia di San Paolo and Politecnico di Torino. I work in the blockchain and distributed systems unit.

- **[Department of Computer Science, University of Turin](https://www.di.unito.it/do/home.pl)** -- My academic home within the National PhD Programme ISAS, where I collaborate with researchers in distributed ledger technologies.

I have also worked with researchers at:
- [Brunel University London](https://www.brunel.ac.uk/) (visiting researcher, 2024-2025)
- [CITIC, Universidade da Coru&ntilde;a](https://citic.udc.es/) (international collaboration on DLT-based solutions)
