## Research Areas

<div class="research-area">
  <h3><span class="research-icon">&#9878;</span> Blockchain-Based Data Marketplaces</h3>
  <p>
    I design and evaluate decentralized data marketplace architectures, with a strong focus on the <strong>energy domain</strong>.
    My work addresses the challenges of privacy, trust, and interoperability in data exchange, integrating
    technologies such as the Ocean Protocol, IDSA connectors, and GAIA-X dataspaces. A key result is a
    sub-8 second decentralized marketplace for energy data, demonstrating practical feasibility at scale.

<div class="research-area">
  <h3><span class="research-icon">&#9881;</span> DAO Governance & Sustainability</h3>
  <p>
    I investigate <strong>Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)</strong> through the lens of governance sustainability
    and longevity. My work includes defining on-chain governance metrics, developing game-theoretic incentive models,
    and analyzing empirical data from existing DAOs to understand what makes decentralized governance work long-term.

<div class="research-area">
  <h3><span class="research-icon">&#128274;</span> Privacy-Preserving Cryptographic Techniques</h3>
  <p>
    I explore practical applications of advanced cryptographic primitives including <strong>Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proofs</strong>,
    <strong>Multi-Party Computation (MPC)</strong>, and <strong>Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)</strong>. The goal is to
    bring these techniques from theory to practice in blockchain systems, enabling privacy-preserving computations and
    verifiable data exchanges.

## Collaborators & Groups

My research is carried out within two main groups:

- **[Links Foundation](https://linksfoundation.com/en/)** (Torino) &mdash; Applied research centre working on digital transformation, established by Compagnia di San Paolo and Politecnico di Torino. I work in the blockchain and distributed systems research unit.

- **[Department of Computer Science, University of Turin](https://www.di.unito.it/do/home.pl)** &mdash; My academic home within the National PhD Programme ISAS. Research supervised by experts in distributed ledger technologies.

I have also collaborated with researchers at:
- [Brunel University London](https://www.brunel.ac.uk/) (visiting researcher, 2024&ndash;2025)
- [CITIC, Universidade da Coru&ntilde;a](https://citic.udc.es/) (international collaboration on DLT-based solutions)
